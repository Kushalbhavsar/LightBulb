# LightBulb

Reading in the dark? ðŸŒ‘

Just built a personal lightsaber for reading, an interactive bulb element ðŸ’¡ that can shed light on the page and illuminate the text in #SwiftUI!  

The Ultimate reading companion. ðŸ“–

Scroll through pages of text while manipulating an interactive, color-changing bulb that illuminates the text as you move it around the screen.
